## Data Overview
We analyzed the following quarterly growth percentages:
* **Q1:** 4.28
* **Q2:** 4.1
* **Q3:** 9.21
* **Q4:** 10.5

## Key Findings
1.  **Performance Gap:** Our calculated **average MRR growth is 7.02**, which is significantly lower than the **industry target of 15**.
2.  **Positive Trend:** While Q1 and Q2 showed stagnation (~4%), we observed a strong recovery in the second half of the year, with Q4 reaching 10.5.
3.  **Volatility:** The growth is inconsistent, indicating that current retention or acquisition strategies fluctuate in effectiveness.

## Business Implications
The current growth rate (7.02 avg) suggests we are losing market share to faster-growing competitors. Failing to meet the target of 15 limits our valuation and available capital for reinvestment. The recovery in Q3 and Q4 is promising but insufficient to close the annual gap without a strategic pivot.

## Recommendations
To bridge the gap between our current 7.02 average and the target of 15, we must look beyond our current customer base.

**Primary Solution:**
We must **expand into new market segments**. 

By diversifying our target audience and adapting our SaaS offering for adjacent verticals, we can accelerate the momentum seen in Q4 and align with industry benchmarks in the upcoming fiscal year.
